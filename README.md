# Amazon_AWS
Implementing AWS Services in Java


1)	Download vaadin plugin for eclipse, since the project is developed on top of vaadin framework

Help-> Eclipse market place -> type vaadin -> Install vaadin
2)	Run tomcat 6 server on local machine. To run vaadin projects, it is easy to run on server. So I suggest to run on tomcat6 server.
3)	JDK version, jdk_1.7.0_79 version (minimum)
4)	Download AWS Java SDK from below website and add the necessary jar files to the build path
https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/
5)	Download Jersy package which is used to parse the JSON file
https://jersey.java.net/download.html
6)	Make sure that all the jar files are included in the build path
7)	Please add the jar files to tomcat, lib folder (..\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 6.0\lib) 
8)	If the necessary jar files are imported to build path, the project should get successfully compiled

Screenshots of each step to run the project is demonstrated in another document
